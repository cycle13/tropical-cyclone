# Statistical Study of Tropical Cyclone in North Western Pacific Region

This repository contains historical Western Pacific cyclone data pulled from [Naval Oceanography Portal](http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/wpindex.php) as well as Python programmes that help to extract statistical data from the dataset. 

This is done as my Physics undergraduate research.

Improvement to methods are very welcome.
